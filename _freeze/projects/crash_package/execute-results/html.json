Doing everything in R would be more efficient. It came to a point where I was constantly sourcing the same scripts so it was logical to turn these scripts into an R package. The package has functions that query certain crash flags so I don't have to look up the actual query. On the backend, data is stored in a SQL database, one that I created and updates automatically on a weekly basis. Importing data multiple times a day and unable to store tihs data in the cloud, I found duckdb to be the fastest solution (as compared to csv, SQLite, and fst).\n\n### Highlighted packages\n\nThe dashboard uses `data.table, duckdb, fst`, and `purrr`.\n",
