As a solution, I created a SQLite database as the database is saved locally inside the package. While this dramitically improved performance, data was still being mapped on-the-fly. Ideally the data should be stored in a spatial database. This app also uses modules so server and ui are much cleaner while the code is easier to debug.\n\n### Highlighted packages\n\n`plotly, leaflet, leaflet.extras2` and `leafgl` under a `golem` framework.\n",
