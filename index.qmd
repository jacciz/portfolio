## Greetings!

I am a data analyst and R programmer. My passion for R sparked when I felt frustrated of the mundane workflow at my previous job from SAS/Excel and knew there had to be a better way. I took an online programming class and immediately applied what I learned to my job.

Since then, I've built an R package to improve work flow, developed Shiny web apps, and automated long reports. I enjoy translating data into a concise and meaningful visual for a general audience in either a dashboard or a report.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy graphing my coffee roasts, playing strategy board games, and cycling.
