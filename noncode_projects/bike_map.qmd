### What I learned

I wanted to learn Adobe Illustrator, so I made a bike map path of Madison, WI. I started off with using QGIS to get the streets. Then in Illustrator, I kind of traced over these roads. As I wanted to maintain the subway style, the rule was that all lines and polygons had to use 45 degree angles.
