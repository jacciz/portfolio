### What I learned

I learned to create a parameterized R Markdown report. I used our crash data API for the maps using the `googleway` package. This project was previously done using Excel and Publisher and took many months. This project fully automated the report by using "County" as the parameter.

### Highlighted packages

`plotly, googleway`, and `kableExtra`
