title: "WisDOT Crash Comparison Dashboard"
description: "I was asked to create a visual that compares crashes by quarter. This was previously done manually in Excel, needing to find the number of crashes for each crash flag/type for each quarter. This dashboard displays a series of bar charts and the ability to download this data."

### What I learned

Knowing this dashboard would be viewed on a variety of screen sizes, I used dynamic font sizes (i.e. 1.2em) as opposed to static font sizes (i.e. 12pt). I also wrote CSS as to make printing of the entire dashboard possible on two pages.

### Highlighted packages

The dashboard uses `dashboardthemes, ggplot2 and ggtext` using the `golem` framework.
