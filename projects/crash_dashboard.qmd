### What I learned

Through performance testing via `shinyloadtest`, I found an enormous bottleneck through simply loading the data. As a solution, I created a SQLite database as the database is saved locally inside the package. While this dramitically improved performance, data was still being mapped on-the-fly. Ideally the data should be stored in a spatial database. This app also uses modules so server and ui are much cleaner while the code is easier to debug.

### Highlighted packages

The dashboard uses `plotly, leaflet, leaflet.extras2` and `leafgl` under a `golem` framework.
