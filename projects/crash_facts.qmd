title: "Wisconsin Traffic Crash Facts"
description: "This is a crash facts book done in a web format. I was excited to use the newly released Quarto by Posit. The book provides many tables and charts of crash data. Past versions were done in Excel/Publisher exported to a 100+ page PDF; <a href = 'https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/safety/education/crash-data/2013/wtcf.pdf'>see here</a>. This is now fully automated and a book can be created in a matter of minutes as opposed to weeks."

### What I learned

I learned YAML and Quarto! I spent the most time writing functions to standardize the table format, render charts, and to more easily aggregate the data.
