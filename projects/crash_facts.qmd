title: "Wisconsin Traffic Crash Facts"
description: "Originally a 100+ page PDF book, I made it into an online crash facts book using Quarto. The book provides tables and charts of aggregated crash data. Past versions were done in <a href = 'https://wisconsindot.gov/Documents/safety/education/crash-data/2013/wtcf.pdf'>Excel/Publishere</a>. This project now automates the creation of this book. A new book can be created within a day as opposed to many weeks."

### What I learned

This project gave me an excuse to learn Quarto! I spent most time writing functions to standardize the table format, to render ggplot charts, and to aggregate the data. Then it was just a matter of creating each chapter using these functions.
