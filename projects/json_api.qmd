### What I learned

The analysis was done it two parts

1)  Writing functions that pulls data from our court case API into a JSON format over a certain time period and for certain citations. This data was flattened and compiled into a single dataframe and exported as an RDS file.

2)  Finding the sentence length for a certain citation for each case. This was tricky as one case may have multiple citations while sentence lengths can be found in multiple branches of the flattened JSON. I solved this issue by finding which branch a certain location was found and replaced part of the branch name with where the sentence length location. I was able to extract the sentence length with this 'renaming.' to calculate the average sentence length.
