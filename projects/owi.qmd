### What I learned

Working with two researchers from the University of Wisconsin, this project involved the compilation of 5 data sets to calculate OWI (operating while intoxicated) ratios broken down by age group, race and sex. In order to combine these datasets, I had to rename columns and recode variables so datasets can be joined. The entire analysis I wrote functions to allow for any combo of age, sex, and race (the variables the study involved).
